<h1 class="todayText">learned where quantum computing originated from. quantum computing comes from many disciplines such as quantum mechanics, computer science, and math. it started to become a study of research when engineers were trying to make transistors smaller so that they can fit more of them onto chips. when there are more transistors, computers are more powerful. however, as transistors became smaller, the properties of quantum mechanics began to affect them, making transistors unable to function correctly. therefore, they began to study more on quantum mechanics and the idea of quantum computing began to form.</h1>
